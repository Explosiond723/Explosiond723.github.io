# Exhibitions & Public Work

This page documents public moments where my photography left the private archive and became an object in the world: printed, shared, discussed, sometimes sold.

## Untitled — 2024 (Associazione Cocci Rotti)

A curated selection that marked my first personal exhibition.
The series leaned into contrast, darker tones, and an emotional narrative that becomes clearer through sequencing.

**Status:** past exhibition · **Format:** printed works · **Location:** Ravenna area

## MAR Museum (Ravenna) — Collective cultural event

A smaller, more chaotic collective show during a university cultural initiative hosted at the MAR.
Each participating artist presented a few works; my contribution was a small set of printed photographs, some of which were sold during the event.

The night wasn’t built around the artists alone — people also came to drink, dance, and listen to a DJ — but it still mattered: it was photography meeting an audience that didn’t arrive “for photography”.

**Status:** past group event · **Format:** printed works · **Context:** mixed cultural/social night
