# About

I work as a DevOps / infrastructure engineer with a strong bias for Linux-based systems, Kubernetes platforms, and pragmatic automation. I enjoy turning operational chaos into repeatable processes: runbooks, pipelines, and small scripts that remove human fragility from production work.

In parallel, photography is my primary artistic language. My images are often captured instinctively and understood later — a process that mirrors how complex systems reveal their meaning over time: patterns emerge after noise.

This website holds both paths, not as separate identities but as complementary tools:
reliability and uncertainty, discipline and drift, logs and shadows.
